My Flags is a website to generate shareable links with information about pride flags. Members of the community aren't always defined by a single idea, and the ability to change the labels and symbols we use is a ley part of many people's discovery of who they are. This site aims to break down barriers and allow people outside of the rainbow community to learn about queer identities and symbols without the initial awkward questions.
