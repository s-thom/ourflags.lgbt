Agender is literally translates as "without gender", and refers to people whose
identity simply doesn't include the social ideas of gender, and feel more
defined by the absence of those ideas.

Agender (literally "without gender") is a term for people who do not identify
with any gender, or whose identity does not include gender. The label is not a
gender, in itself, but a declaration of the lack of gender.

# Flag history

The agender flag was created in 2014 by Salem X, after seeing a large influx of
discussion around identities. Hearing the term agender stuck with them, so they
decided to create a flag to represent it.

The black, gray, and white stripes represent a spectrum of identities, ranging
from those who feel strongly about gender to those who don't feel it at all. The
green stripe is the opposite of the purple stripes seen in the
[Genderqueer](/flags/genderqueer) and [Non-binary](/flags/nonbinary) flags,
which represent a mix of the traditional gendered colors.
