visible at birth, or may only develop during puberty.

# Flag History

The intersex flag was designed in 2013 by Morgan Carpenter, Executive Director
of Intersex Human Rights Australia. Morgan sought to create a flag that wasn't
derivative of existing pride flags, but to instead create something new but
still grounded in meaning. The colors yellow and purple are often used in other
pride flags to represent those outside of gender norms, such as in the
[Non-binary flag](/flags/nonbinary). The circle in the centre is unbroken and
unornamented, complete as it is. It's a statement of who intersex people are,
and who they intend to be.

## Variations

In 2021, the intersex flag was added to the
[Progress pride flag](/flags/progress) by Intersex Equality Rights UK to create
[a new design](/flags/progress-intersex).
