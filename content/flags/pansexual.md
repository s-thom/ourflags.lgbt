Pansexuality is an attraction regardless of gender, meaning that gender plays no
part in the attraction a pansexual person may have for another.

---

Pansexuality is derived from the Greek prefix _pan-_, meaning all. Pansexuality
defines itself as attraction regardless of gender, which means that someone's
gender does not factor into whether they are attracted or not. Some pansexual
people may still have preferences.

# Flag history

The pansexual flag was created in 2010 by Jasper, who saw the need for a
commonly used symbol within the pansexual community.

- Magenta/Pink: The traditional color of femininity.
- Yellow: A color not associated with the gender binary, which represents
  everyone outside of the male/female binary.
- Blue: The traditional color of masculinity.
