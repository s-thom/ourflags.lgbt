Allies are people outside the community who are willing to stand up and fight
for the rights of LGBTQIA+ people. Allies form an important part of the
community, providing greater power to social movements.

Allies are people outside of the LGBTQIA+ community that support the civil
rights and equality of those within the community. Allies have an important role
in amplifying the voices of marginalized people and their perspectives, and are
active in standing up for injustices.

## Being an ally

The Human Rights Campaign, an organisation that focuses on LGBTQIA+ rights, has
some starter resources, with links off to more. Some parts are more focused on
the United States of America, so try to find local organisations that you can
help out too.
