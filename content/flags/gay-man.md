Gay men are men who have a romantic or sexual attraction or orientation towards
other men. Over time the term "gay" has become generic, so "gay men" is used to
refer to male homosexuality.

Gay men are men who are gay. This means they have an attraction or orientation
towards other men.

While the term "gay" has been used in the past to refer to men, it is often used
to refer to the LGBTQIA+ community as a whole. As such, "gay men" is used to
refer to men specifically.

# Flag history

The first known design for the flag was created by a moderator of the Tumblr
blog "ask-pride-color-schemes", named Hermy, in August 2016. This was made as a
request from an anonymous asker, who suggested it should be similar to the
[Lesbian Flag](/flags/lesbian), but with different colors. The colors suggested
were close to the colors of a butch lesbian flag, so Hermy tweaked them
slightly.

In October 2019, Tumblr blog gayflagblog proposed a slightly updated design.
Reasons for updating the flag included changing the stereotypical blue color
associated with men to a more purple color, and reclaiming the flag to
explicitly include men that were being excluded by a group of users of the
previous flag. Hermy, the creator of the first design, stated their support for
the updated design and the people it includes.

Each of the stripes have been given a meaning:

- Green through Teal: Community, healing, joy.
- White: Gender-non-conforming, [non-binary](/flags/nonbinary), and
  [transgender](/flags/transgender) men.
- Purple through Indigo: Pure love, fortitude, diversity.
