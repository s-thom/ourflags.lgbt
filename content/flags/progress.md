Created in 2018, the Progress Pride Flag takes the 6-stripe flag and brings
attention to the issues that transgender and people of color still face today.
The chevron along the hoist shows that progress is being made, but that there is
still a lot to go.

# Flag history

The Progress flag was designed in 2018 by Daniel Quasar, a graphic designer
living in Portland, Oregon. After seeing some other changes being made to the
pride flag to highlight certain issues, such as people of color in the
[Philadelphia design](./rainbow-philadelphia), Daniel thought to create a new
design incorporating multiple identities.

The end result, after many discarded attempts, was adding a chevron to the hoist
edge of the flag. When viewing the obverse side (hoist on the left), the chevron
points to the right, indicating that progress is being made, but there is more
to go.

Each of the new colors have a specific meaning:

- Black: Remembering those lost to the AIDS epidemic, from the Victory over AIDS
  flag.
- Brown: People of color, from the [Philadelphia flag](./rainbow-philadelphia).
- Blue, pink, and white: The colors of the [Transgender flag](./transgender).

## Variants

In 2021, the [Intersex flag](./intersex) was added to the inner triangle by
Intersex Equality Rights UK to create [a new design](./progress-intersex).
