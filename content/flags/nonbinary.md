Non-binary (sometimes "NB" or "Enby") refers to people whose gender identity
falls outside of the male/female gender binary. The name is a declaration that
the commonly accepted notions of gender are not adequate for describing their
experiences.

The term "non-binary" refers to any gender identity or expression that does not
fit within the established binary of male and female. As such, this term covers
a lot of identities and expressions. Some people may prefer to use those more
specific terms, whereas other might use non-binary as a way of getting the idea
across without feeling the need to explain who they are.

Non-binary people often refer to themselves as "enbies", which is derived from
the initialism "N.B." for non-binary.

Non-binary is similar to [genderqueer](/flags/genderqueer), but differentiates
itself by not including the word "queer", which is still seen as a slur in many
places. It also is clear in what it achieved: directly stating that the gender
binary does not fit who they are.

# Flag history

The non-binary flag was designed in 2014 by Kye Rowan as part of a call for
submissions for a non-binary flag distinct from the
[genderqueer flag](/flags/genderqueer).

- Yellow: Being outside the binary. The [intersex flag](/flags/intersex) uses
  yellow for this same reason.
- White: The color of all colors/light. It represents people who are many or all
  genders.
- Purple: Fluidity and multiplicity of many gender experiences, uniqueness and
  flexibility of nonbinary people, those whose gender experiences include being
  of or between female and male.
- Black: The absence of color/light. It represents [agender](/flags/agender) or
  genderlessness.
