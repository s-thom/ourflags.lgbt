periodic, or dependent on the circumstances they find themselves in.

Genderfluid people identify with different genders at different times. This
change in identity and/or expression might be periodic, or based on the
circumstances they find themselves in (where it may be easier for them to be one
gender over another in that situation). Some genderfluid people might flow
between a few genders, or might be pulled in different directions without
knowing.

# Flag history

Designed in 2012 by JJ Poole on Tumblr, the Genderfluid flag was created because
they felt the term [Genderqueer](/flags/genderqueer) was too broad for them, but
there was a lack of visual identity around genderfluidity. Each of the stripes
represents ideas within gender identity and expression:

- Pink: Femininity.
- White: A lack of gender (see also: [Agender](/flags/agender)).
- Purple: A combination of masculinity and femininity.
- Black: All genders.
- Blue: Masculinity.
