Aromanticism is a romantic orientation where people feel little to no romantic
attraction. Aromantic people may still have other forms of relationships, as
romanticism is separate from sexuality or platonic relationships such as
friendships.

Aromanticism is a romantic orientation where people feel little to no romantic
attraction. Some asexual people will feel rare romantic feelings (known as
grayromantic), or only once a strong bond has been formed (demiromantic). Due to
romanticism being subjective, aromantic people may have trouble distinguishing
between romantic and platonic affection given by others.

Aromantic people may still have other forms of relationships. Romanticism is a
separate concept from sexuality or platonic relationships (such as friendships).

# Flag history

The aromantic flag used today was first posted to Tumblr in 2014 by
cameronwhimsy. Each of the stripes is assigned a specific meaning relevant to
aromanticism:

- Green and light green: The aromantic spectrum, including grayromantic and
  demiromantic.
- White: The "platonic stripe", referring to relationships that are
  affectionate, but not sexual.
- Gray and black: The sexuality spectrum, including asexual, allosexual (the
  opposite of asexual), and all in-between.
