# Flag history

In 1999 Monica Helms was talking with Michael Page (designer of the
[Bisexual Flag](./bisexual) the previous year), when she got the suggestion to
design a flag for the transgender community. She completed the design in August
1999, and flew it in the Phoenix Pride Parade the next year.

The blue and pink stripes represent the colors generally given to baby boys and
girls, respectively, with the white stripe representing those who do not
identify with the gender binary. The flag's colors are mirrored vertically so
that it is correct no matter which way it is flown.

## Variations

The transgender flag's colors have been included in other flags to highlight the
issues that transgender people still face in the world today. A notable example
is its inclusion in the [Progress Pride Flag](./progress) in 2018.
