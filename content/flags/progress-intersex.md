# Flag History

In 2021, intersex rights activist and founder of Intersex Equality Rights UK,
Valentino Vecchietti, made a variation of the [Progress Pride Flag](./progress)
by including the motif of the [Intersex flag](./intersex). The Intersex flag
itself was designed in 2013 by Morgan Carpenter, Executive Director of Intersex
Human Rights Australia.

The inclusion of the Intersex flag into the Progress flag highlights that the
rights and bodily autonomy of intersex people has a long way to go, with most
countries in the world still allowing non-consensual medical interventions
against intersex people.
