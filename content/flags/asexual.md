Asexual people feel little to no sexual attraction towards others. They may
still have romantic relationships, or meet their emotional needs in other ways.

Asexuality is a sexual orientation where people do not feel sexually attracted
to others.

An asexual person doesn't necessarily dislike sex, as orientation is about who
you feel attracted to. Some asexuals are sex-favourable, meaning they are
willing to participate in sexual acts, while others are sex-averse and prefer
not to get intimate.

Asexuality also differs from celibacy and abstinence. Celibacy is not having
sex. Abstinence is choosing not to have sex. Asexuality, on the other hand, is
not having any sexual attraction, and is separate from the other two.

# Flag history

The asexual flag design was voted for in 2010 by users of the Asexual Visibility
and Education Network (AVEN) forums. The chosen design was first submitted by
the user "standup", and received over 40% of the votes. Interestingly, the
colors of the flag proposals seem to have pre-dated the flag vote, so most
submissions stuck to the same color scheme. Each of the colors were prescribed
meaning, as follows:

- Black: Asexual.
- Gray: Demi- and graysexual.
- White: Allosexual (opposite of asexual).
- Purple: The asexual community.
