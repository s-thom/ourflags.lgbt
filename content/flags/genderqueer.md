Genderqueer has become an umbrella term for gender identities that don't conform
to the idea of a gender binary. The name explicitly calls out the non-normative
experience that genderqueer people have with their gender.

Genderqueer is a term for people whose gender identity or expression doesn't
conform to the gender binary. It is used by people as an umbrella term, covering
a wide range of identities, as well as by people who don't want to be too
specific when communicating aspects of their own identity.

Genderqueer is similar to [non-binary](/flags/nonbinary), but distinct in the
message it sends by including "queer" in the name.

# Flag history

The first version of the genderqueer flag was created by Marilyn Roxie in 2010,
with slight changes to the colors in 2011 and 2012. Each of the stripes
represent an idea within (or outside of) gender, but are not meant to be
exclusive of each other.

- Lavender: A mixture of pink and blue, the colors most associated with
  femininity and masculinity respectively.
- White: [Agender](/flags/agender), or a lack of gender.
- Green: The inverse of lavender, representing those outside of the male/female
  gender binary.
