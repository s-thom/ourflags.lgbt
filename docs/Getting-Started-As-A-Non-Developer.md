# Getting started as a non-developer

There are a few ways that people unfamiliar with writing code can help make this website better. You will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to make changes, as this project is hosted there.

## Reporting issues

If you find an issue while using the website, you can submit a bug report on [the issues page](https://github.com/s-thom/ourflags.lgbt/issues). First, search to see if your issue has been reported before. If this is the first time it is being raised, then you can click the "New issue" button to create a new report.

## Writing

> ðŸ†• If you're looking to add a new flag, make sure to read the "[Adding a new flag](./Adding-A-New-Flag.md)" page.

A large portion of this project doesn't involve code. In order to have easy-to-read text for people to read, it must first be written.

Most of this work is in the [`content/flags/` folder](https://github.com/s-thom/ourflags.lgbt/tree/main/content/flags), where each flag has its own file. Each file is split into three sections by a `---`: metadata, excerpt, and content. The excerpt is what is shown on the shared pages, and the content appears on each flag's "Read more" page.

If you aren't set up for local development, you can make change online in GitHub. Once you've opened up the file you want to edit, click the "Edit this file" button (a pencil icon) to open up an editor. You can use Markdown for formatting, such as splitting up the content with headings. When you're ready to submit for review, click the "Commit changes" button and make sure to create a pull request.

## Design and Accessibility

I, primarily, am a programmer. While I do have a little bit of an eye for design, that doesn't always translate to my fingers. If you have ideas for how we can improve the visual identity of the site, then I'd love to hear them. I realise this is a lot to ask for, especially in an open source project, so I have no expectation for anything in this space.
