# Contribution guidelines

First of all, thanks for checking the project out and then taking the next step to help make it better. The ability for a wide variety of people to build towards a common goal is absolutely what the internet is for. Open source would not be what it is without other people being willing to take their time to work on a community project.

## Code of Conduct

By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [code of conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). This outlines the kinds of behaviours that are and aren't OK, as well as the expected steps to dealing with any conflicts that arise.

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines:

- If you find a security vulnerability, please disclose it responsibly by sending an email to _`myflags+security@`[`[domain on my profile]`](https://github.com/s-thom)_.
- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- Remember the human. This project is maintained in people's spare time, so responses might not be immediate.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the site, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

If you find an existing Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. [Adding a reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help us know that a particular problem is affecting more than just the original reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement added to the site. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question. If you have multiple things you'd like to work on, do those in separate PRs.
- If relevant, update documentation.
- Use the provided Pull Request template (which should appear when a new PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

## A note on the use of AI

AI generated content is _not accepted_ in this project. Text generation systems, and AI in general, does its absolute best to get _an_ answer, but has little knowledge of real-world correctness. Content written by humans puts the burden of discerning truth much more on the shoulders of the writer, and the reviewer can follow the sources given to evaluate for themselves. AI generated content flips that responsibility on its head, putting a lot more work in the review process. This puts an unnecessary burden on the maintainers of a project.
